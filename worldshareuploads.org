** Exporting files for upload
     - Records should be exported from Aleph using *Services ->
       Download Machine Readable Records (print-03)*
       - Export records as *"MARC xml"*
	 - Do NOT export as *"MARC xml with alphanumeric tags."* These
           tags are proprietary Ex Libris fields which are not in the
           MARC standard and will cause the file to be rejected.

** Preparing files for upload
   + File naming convention
     - See [[https://help.oclc.org/Metadata_Services/WorldShare_Collection_Manager/Data_sync_collections/Create_an_ongoing_data_sync_collection/Bibliographic_collection/30Upload_files_inMy_Files?sl=en#File_naming_conventions][File naming conventions - OCLC Support]]
     - the filename MUST follow this naming convention:
       - Elements are separated by periods
       - The first element is the collection ID. ex: 1039980
       - The second element is the institution symbol ex: MAJV2 (AJHS)
       - the third element is a name of your choosing, which should
         have some relevance to the records being uploaded
       - followed by the file extension, in this case xml
     - An example filename would be ~1039980.MJAV2i77.xml~
   + Editing the file
     - Before uploading, you must make the following edits to the file:
       - The export will have the schema definitions listed before
	 each ~<record>~ element. Remove them from the individual
	 ~<record>~ elements and make sure they are only in the
	 top-level element.
       - Delete the blank line separating records.
       - Move the 001 control field from the end of each record to the
         beginning of the record.
